# Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set Code Book
## All listed variables are expressed as a means (except Activity, Subject and Mode) of all reading for a particular subject for a particular activity
## Variables starting with "t" are time based measurements and were captured at 50 Hz
## Body or Gravity indicate they signals were further filtered for one or the other
## Acc indicates a measurement of acceleration
## XYZ indicated the three axises of measurements
* tBodyAcc.mean...Y
* tBodyAcc.mean...Z
* tBodyAcc.std...X
* tBodyAcc.std...Y
* tBodyAcc.std...Z
* tGravityAcc.mean...X
* tGravityAcc.mean...Y
* tGravityAcc.mean...Z
* tGravityAcc.std...X
* tGravityAcc.std...Y
* tGravityAcc.std...Z
